# TEST STAGE

You are in the TEST stage of the development loop.

## Context Files
- `@IN_PROGRESS.md` - Current task state (MUST exist)

## Instructions

### Step 0: Check Lock

If file `AUTOMATION_LOCK` exists:
1. Read its timestamp
2. If timestamp is less than 1 hour old: **EXIT** (another agent is working)
3. If timestamp is stale (>1 hour), proceed (previous agent likely crashed)

Create or update `AUTOMATION_LOCK` with current ISO timestamp before proceeding.

### Step 1: Verify Stage

Read IN_PROGRESS.md and verify:
- `**Stage**: test` is set
- The file exists (if not, something went wrong - report error and exit)

Update **Last Heartbeat** timestamp.

### Step 1.5: Verify Build

Run the build to ensure code compiles:

```bash
npm run build
```

**If build FAILS:**
1. Analyze the build errors carefully
2. Update IN_PROGRESS.md:
   - Add build errors to "TODOs" section with clear descriptions:
     ```markdown
     ## TODOs (feed back to implement)
     - [ ] Build: [specific file:line] - [description of build error]
     ```
   - Set `**Stage**: implement` (loop back)
   - Add to "Iteration Log": "Build failed - [summary of errors]"
3. EXIT

**If build PASSES:** Continue to Step 2.

### Step 2: Run Tests

Run the appropriate test command based on what was modified:

**If only backend files changed:**
```bash
npm run test:backend
```

**If only frontend files changed:**
```bash
npm run test:frontend
```

**If both or unclear:**
```bash
npm test
```

Also run type checking:
```bash
npm run typecheck
```

### Step 3: Analyze Results

**If ALL tests PASS and type checking succeeds:**
1. Update IN_PROGRESS.md:
   - Set `**Stage**: review`
   - Update "Stage Status" - check test
   - Update **Last Heartbeat** timestamp
   - Add to "Iteration Log": "Tests passed, typecheck passed"
2. EXIT

**If tests FAIL or type checking fails:**
1. Analyze the failures carefully
2. Create specific, actionable fix items
3. Update IN_PROGRESS.md:
   - Add failure items to "TODOs" section with clear descriptions:
     ```markdown
     ## TODOs (feed back to implement)
     - [ ] Fix: [specific file:line] - [description of what needs fixing]
     - [ ] Fix: [another specific issue]
     ```
   - Set `**Stage**: implement` (loop back)
   - Update **Last Heartbeat** timestamp
   - Add to "Iteration Log": "Tests failed - [summary of failures]"
4. EXIT

### Step 4: EXIT

**STOP HERE.** Do not:
- Fix the code yourself (that's the IMPLEMENT stage)
- Commit anything (that's the COMMIT stage)
- Review beyond test results (that's the REVIEW stage)

### EXIT
STOP processing. The orchestration layer will:
1. Re-read IN_PROGRESS.md (or detect its absence)
2. Determine stage from file content
3. Route to appropriate PROMPT_*.md
4. Start new agent session

The loop will invoke the appropriate next stage.

## Guidelines

1. Be specific in failure analysis - include file paths and line numbers
2. Group related failures into single TODOs where appropriate
3. If tests unrelated to current work fail, still add them to TODOs - they must be resolved before commit
4. Do not skip failing tests - all tests must pass
5. Build verification catches compile errors early, before running tests
